This repository contains materials for Cloudera's Services Enablement
Boot Camp and Cloudera FCE's internal boot camp.

If you've received this repo as a ZIP file, please follow the
instructions that were included in the email to initialize your
repo. You can make your GitHub repo Private or Public.  It does
not matter to the course which option you use.

<strong>NOTE</strong>: DO NOT add files directly to GitHub. Use
your GitHub copy only to publish your lab work from a local copy.
Make sure at all times that the most recent version of your work
is on your laptop.

Add your instructors as Collaborators to your GitHub repo. This
privilege lets them create pull requests on GitHub so you can review
their edits and accept changes if you wish. If you're unfamiliar
with `git` commands, consult with an instructor or a knowledgable
colleague.

To keep track of your progress, we use GitHub's Issues feature. For
each lab section, we'll ask you to create an Issue and use it to
provide brief updates on your your work. We also use GitHub labels
to give the current state of each lab (e.g., submitted, incomplete,
complete). Finally, we use GitHub milestones to distinguish your
labs from your challenge work.

In a large class, it can take time for an instructor to assist you.
If you have a lab problem, describe in your current Issue what the
problem is. Include error messages or stack traces in an Issue
comment, or take a screenshot that shows your cluster's condition.
In short, use the wait time to document your problem.

Before you start labs, make the following changes to your GitHub
repo:

* Add your collaborators under `Settings -> Collaborators`.
* Enable `Issues` under `Settings -> Options`. Click the `Features` box and enable `Issues`.
* Click the `Issues` tab and the `Milestones` button
    * Create two milestones: `Labs` and `Challenges`
    * Set the deadlines for Thursday and Friday of the training week.
* Click the `Labels` button and change your labels as follows:
    * Change `bug` to `stuck` 
    * Change `duplicate` to `started`
    * Change `enhancement` to `didNotSubmit`
    * Change `help wanted` to `complete`
    * Change `invalid` to `review`
    * Change `wontfix` to `incomplete`; set the label color to `#fbca04`.
    * Leave the `question` Issue as is

Your instructors will open an issue to acknowledge their Collaborator
status and review these settings. No lab work is reviewed until
this work is done.
